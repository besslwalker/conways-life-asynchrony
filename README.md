conways-life-asynchrony
=======================

An implementation of Conway's Game of Life for the interview process with Asynchrony.

The brief:
Write an implementation of “Conways Game of Life” using java, including any unit tests you create in the process.  Please do not send binaries (exe's or dll's) so the file will make it through our firewall, but include enough files so that we can build your sample application and run it.
